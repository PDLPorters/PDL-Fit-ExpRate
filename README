PDL::Fit::ExpRate

DESCRIPTION

This distribution includes two modules. The primary module is
PDL::Fit::ExpRate, which provides a PDL method for fitting the
parameters to a noisy exponential decay. The implementation of that
function includes lots of other smaller functions, and most of these
are also wrapped into PDL methods and provided by this module.

A secondary module is PDL::PP::Include::Fit::ExpRate. The exponential
fitting code provided by PDL::Fit::ExpRate is implemented with normal C
functions, and this module tries to make it as easy as possible for you
to use those C functions in your own PDL code.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, you will need Module::Build and PDL already
installed. Once you have those, use the normal Module::Build incantation,
which is

   *nix/Mac            Windows
 perl Build.PL      perl Build.PL
 ./Build            Build
 ./Build test       Build test
 ./Build install    Build install
